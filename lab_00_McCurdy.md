## Write-up: 
# 1.	Have you identified your research topic / or research question?  If so, what is it?

I have not. I'm not quite sure yet what the possibilites are so its hard to narrow down a topic without knowing to what degree of depth of research is required. 

# 2.	Who is your advisor?  

Dr. Mark Reith

# 3.	What do you want to learn from this class?

What are the most popular vulnerabilities and attacks that affect SCADA and Mobile devices as well as how to do those attacks and what defenses we have in place to stop them.

# 4.	When it comes to academic scholarship, what are your strengths and what are your weaknesses?

I believe I am quick at learning new topics however I am a cronic procrastinator.

# 5.	What did you study in your undergraduate degree?

Cyber Science and Computer Science

# 6.	Do you have any development experience (e.g., programming, scripting)?  If so, briefly discuss. 

I did some programming assignments in undergrad however other than that none. Coded basic video games, created a website, created different types of calculators and databases, etc.

# 7.	Do you have any experience in embedded development or reverse engineering of mobile devices?  If so, briefly discuss. 

I have no experience in these topics.

# 8.	On a scale of 1 – 5 (1 novice and 5 experts), how competent are you with the Linux command line?

4/5 - I am more than confident however I'm sure there will always be stuff I have to google.

# 9.	In your own words, what is research, and what is the benefit of it to the Air Force?  

Research is creating new sources of information or combining existings pieces of information to create something new. It benefits the Air Force in many ways a few of which
would be better technology and better understanding of those technologies as well as the environments they will operate in.

# 10.	Identify 5 examples of SCADA/ICS systems and discuss why it is essential that they be secure?  

1.
2.
3.
4.
5


# 11.	Discuss 2 examples where critical systems have been compromised and discuss the impacts.

# 12.	Discuss 2 examples where Mobile-Internet of Thing (M-IoT) devices have been compromised and discuss the impacts.

# 13.	How would this class support your research goals?   

# 14.	If you had unlimited time and money to design a mobile app, what would you make?  How would you make it secure?

# 15.	Over Christmas, a relative with no security/computer background, asks you “what do I need to do to make my phone safe so that I don’t get hacked?”  How do you answer this?

# 16.	If you and some friends got lost hiking in the woods, what would you do first?

    a) Stay in the same spot, wait for help to arrive, and tell stories with your friends to pass the time? 

    b) Immediately head back in the direction of your car, even if this means leaving the trail and your group  

    c) Continue the hike, enjoy nature, and plan to run into a park ranger or find a trailhead at some point.  

    d) Pull out the map, identify your last known location; divide into groups to find help.
