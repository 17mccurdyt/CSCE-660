# CSCE 660, Lab 0: Survey - 2Lt Thomas J. McCurdy

## Objective:  
Receive a baseline assessment of students 


## Due Date: 
2200 on 5 April 2022

## Write-up: 
### 1.	Have you identified your research topic / or research question?  If so, what is it?

I have not. I'm not quite sure yet what the possibilites are so its hard to narrow down a topic without knowing to what degree of depth of research is required. 

### 2.	Who is your advisor?  

Dr. Mark Reith

### 3.	What do you want to learn from this class?

What are the most popular vulnerabilities and attacks that affect SCADA and Mobile devices as well as how to do those attacks and what defenses we have in place to stop them.

### 4.	When it comes to academic scholarship, what are your strengths and what are your weaknesses?

I believe I am quick at learning new topics however I am a cronic procrastinator.

### 5.	What did you study in your undergraduate degree?

Cyber Science and Computer Science

### 6.	Do you have any development experience (e.g., programming, scripting)?  If so, briefly discuss. 

I did some programming assignments in undergrad however other than that none. Coded basic video games, created a website, created different types of calculators and databases, etc.

### 7.	Do you have any experience in embedded development or reverse engineering of mobile devices?  If so, briefly discuss. 

I have no experience in these topics.

### 8.	On a scale of 1 – 5 (1 novice and 5 experts), how competent are you with the Linux command line?

4/5 - I am more than confident however I'm sure there will always be stuff I have to google.

### 9.	In your own words, what is research, and what is the benefit of it to the Air Force?  

Research is creating new sources of information or combining existings pieces of information to create something new. It benefits the Air Force in many ways a few of which
would be better technology and better understanding of those technologies as well as the environments they will operate in.

### 10.	Identify 5 examples of SCADA/ICS systems and discuss why it is essential that they be secure?  

1. Power Generation
2. Oil Refineries
3. Water and Sewage Treatment
4. Parts Manufacturing
5. Public Transport

The security of the SCADA/ICS devices is essential because they are what physically control the many moving parts in these systems. As the name entails they are provide supervisory control and data acquisition. If these vital tasks can be corrupted, a plethora of very bad things can happen. 

### 11.	Discuss 2 examples where critical systems have been compromised and discuss the impacts.

1. A common example was the Stuxnet weapon which targeted Iranian centrifuges and made them tear themselves apart. The impact was physical in the sense that important machinery was destroyed resulting in heavy setbacks to their nuclear program.
2. Another example was the Target credit card hack where attackers used a SCADA device as an access point onto the larger Target network in order to upload a virus that would steal credit card infromation when customers used the registers. The impact was economic as customers and Target lost millions of dollars in theft/damages.

### 12.	Discuss 2 examples where Mobile-Internet of Thing (M-IoT) devices have been compromised and discuss the impacts.

1. One recent example is attackers targeting SIM cards in order to hijack phones to breach cryptocurrency accounts as discussed in the following article: https://securityboulevard.com/2022/03/attackers-deploy-sim-hijacking-to-breach-cryptocurrency-accounts/
2. Another more general example are when security breaches occur where mobile device's source codes are leaked. For example: https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-hack-source-code.

The impacts of M-IoT devices being compromised are large because of the reliance we have on those devices. We use them for a mulitude of tasks and they store most of our sensitive information. They are a gold mine for potential attacks thus they need to be heavily secured.

### 13.	How would this class support your research goals?   

My capstone is focused on developing Cyber Mission Defense Team (MDTs) scenarios for the serious game BattleSpace Next. SCADA and Mobile devices play a vital role in the Department of Defense so having a better understanding of the vulnerabilities they face as well as potential defensive measures will result in better teaching scenarios. 

### 14.	If you had unlimited time and money to design a mobile app, what would you make?  How would you make it secure?

I would develop some sort of video game with the primary purpose of entertainment and competition. I would make it secure by hiring a professional with my infinite money. If I had to do it myself I would look into encrpytion methods for any forms of payment, communication/connections, or acount information as well as limit the number of ways users can interact with the underlying control systems. 

### 15.	Over Christmas, a relative with no security/computer background, asks you “what do I need to do to make my phone safe so that I don’t get hacked?”  How do you answer this?

Don't plug your phone into strange computers or sketchy outlets/usb ports. Don't connect to WiFi's that you don't trust (random public ones that aren't hosted by a company). Don'y search and download random files of the internet. Keep it up to date on security updates. 

### 16.	If you and some friends got lost hiking in the woods, what would you do first?

Most of my friends are into serious mountaineering so I would probably default to their leadership. In my opinion, the best course of action would probably be to stay together rather than split up. Then I would check my phone for connection, pull out any maps we have to try and find where we are, or move to a close vantage point to see if we can get our bearing. If all that fails It would depend on how lost we are. If we are super lost I'd probably stay where we are and wait for help (assuming we told people where we were hiking). If we were midly lost I think we could spend some time trying to backtrack and find the trail.
