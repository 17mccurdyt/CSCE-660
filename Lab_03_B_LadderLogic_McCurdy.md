# Lab 03 B - Ladder Logic Familiarization

## Due: 19 April

Turn-in will be through Teams


## Objective

This lab is intended to give you a basic understanding of process control and programming in Ladder Logic. 

You are permitted to view/reference the ladder logic files from Github, but you may NOT copy-paste any code from them. The point is for you to get familiar with the language and the programming interface.

## Reference

https://github.com/sdunlap-afit/hilics



## Garage Door

1.	Carefully **review** the documentation here (you do not need to follow the instructions, but the information there will enable you to follow the remaining instructions here):

    https://github.com/sdunlap-afit/hilics/blob/master/labs/L2_Door_Control.md

1.	Delete the rungs in IO_Test.RSS or create an empty project file. Do not use Door.RSS. 

    **Note: If you create your own project file, you must configure the network settings.**

1.	Write your own Ladder Logic to control the door (including the timer). 

1.	Since you are permitted to look at Door.RSS, it should not take you long to duplicate the functionality (but no copy-paste allowed). Your code may look similar to mine, but you are encouraged to try different solutions as well. Your garage door must meet the criteria listed in 

    https://github.com/sdunlap-afit/hilics/blob/master/labs/L2_Door_Control.md


## For turn-in

Take a screenshot of ``RSLogix`` running your code. 
You may need to zoom out in ``RSLogix`` to see all the code at once.


Make sure your final submission can zoom in enough to see the details. 

If I can’t read it, I’ll contact you for a live demo.

This is an example screenshot. Yours may be similar to mine, but should not be identical.
